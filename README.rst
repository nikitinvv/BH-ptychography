Jupyter Notebooks
================

demo_object_probe.ipynb - ptychography reconstruction of the object and probe with the BH-CG (Conjugate gradient) method 

demo_object_probe_positions.ipynb - ptychography reconstruction of the object, probe, and positions with the BH-CG method 

demo_object_probeQN.ipynb - ptychography reconstruction of the object and probe with the BH-QN (Quasi-Newton) method and convergence comparison with the BH-CG
